# Feature Specification Contract

An implementation-ready CTO feature specification identifies: goal and observable semantics; allowed and forbidden scope;
base branch/commit and feature order; public API and compatibility effects; ownership, lifetime, failure, dependency, platform,
and performance constraints; required files or architectural boundaries; test cases and validation profile; commit/branch
requirements; and blocker/handoff expectations.

If missing information affects architecture or externally visible behavior, stop for CTO review. Local implementation details
that preserve the contract remain the worker's responsibility.
